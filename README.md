vsgCs  â€”  3D Tiles and Cesium ion for VSG
=====
vsgCs is a library for using [3D
Tiles](https://github.com/CesiumGS/3d-tiles) and other geospatial
    content within a [Vulkan Scene Graph](https://github.com/vsg-dev/VulkanSceneGraph) (VSG)
    application. In particular, it can download assets from a 
    [Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-ion/) server.

For streaming and loading content, vsgCs uses the [Cesium Native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native)
package, which also "powers Cesium's runtime integrations for
[Cesium for Unreal](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal),
[Cesium for Unity](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unity), and
[Cesium for Nvidia Omniverse](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-omniverse)."
